Since graduating from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a B.A. in Environmental Studies, I have led field teams to enhance biological diversity, ecosystem health, and cultural and recreational resources on islands in the Pacific region and throughout Southern California. While working at Pohakuloa Training Area on Hawaii Island, I developed and implemented an invasive plant early detection and rapid response program, which involved establishing data collection and mapping standards. This experience solidified my passion for collecting and maintaining tidy data. I am an experienced Program Director with expertise in project management, spatial analysis, and invasion biology. After obtaining my master’s, I will focus on aiding land managers and conservation organizations with developing management priorities based on data science tools and analysis. When not working, I can be found in the ocean, playing capoeira, or volunteering on a remote atoll surrounded by thousands of seabirds.\n            \n            \n            Education\n            Bren School for Environmental Science & Management | Santa Barbara, CA     Master of Environmental Data Science | Expected June 2022\n            The University of Hawaii at Manoa | Honolulu, HI     Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies | 2007\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Julia Parish\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      iNaturalist\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Biography\n              I am currently a candidate for a Master’s in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
