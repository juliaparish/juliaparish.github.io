Since graduating from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a B.A. in Environmental Studies, I have led field teams to enhance biological diversity, ecosystem health, and cultural and recreational resources on islands in the Pacific region and throughout Southern California. While working at Pohakuloa Training Area on Hawaii Island, I developed and implemented an invasive plant early detection and rapid response program, which involved establishing data collection and mapping standards. This experience solidified my passion for collecting and maintaining tidy data. I am an experienced Program Director with expertise in grant writing, project management, and invasive biology. After obtaining my master’s, I will focus on aiding land managers and conservation organizations with developing management priorities based on data science tools and analysis.
