The sanctuary is managed by the State of Hawaii Division of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) and is a part of the Papahānaumokuakea Marine National Monument (PMNM) created in 2006 (PMNM 2008). In 1978, Kure Atoll was included in the Hawaii State Seabird Sanctuary system. The United States Coast Guard constructed a LORAN (long range navigation) terrestrial radio navigation system in 1960 (Woodward 1972) and maintained a year-round presence until 1993. Since 1993, DLNR DOFAW partnered with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to manage the natural resources of the Kure Atoll wildlife sanctuary.\r\nA classic circular coral atoll form, Holaniku is comprised of an enclosed lagoon ringed by 28 km (15 miles) of barrier reef which reaches to depths of 100 meters (328 feet) covering an area of 324 km2 (80,000 acres) (PMNM 2008). It spans 11 km (6 mi) totaling 28 km (15 mi) around the perimeter (NOAA 2010). The sole permanent islet, Green Island, is 209 acres with a peak elevation of 6.1 m (20 ft). There are three ephemeral islets, Sand, Shark and Stark Islands, but only Sand Island is present on a consistent basis. Clague (1996) estimates the atoll’s age at 29.8 million years old. Holaniku occupies a unique position referred to as the ‘Darwin Point’, which is the northern extent of coral reef development (Grigg 1982).\r\nHolaniku is an important breeding site for a sizable and diverse population of wildlife, with several rare or endangered species. Eighteen species of seabirds nest on Holaniku, including Moli or Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis), Ka’upu or Black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes), and ‘Ewa’ewa or Sooty tern (Sterna fuscata). It is a critical stopover site for shorebirds and other migratory birds. Vagrant birds are a common site on or around Green Island. According to Nishida (2001), eleven endemic and nine indigenous Hawaiian arthropods are documented from Holaniku. There is an endemic mite, Hemicheyletia granula, that calls Holaniku home (Goff 1987). In 2001, a botanical survey conducted by Starr et al. documented 83 plant species that either historically or currently occurred on Holaniku. Of these 83 species, 26 are native to Hawaii though not necessarily native to Holaniku (Starr et al 2001). There are currently 15 native and 28 introduced plant species known on Green Island. Native plants are an integral resource for seabird nesting habitat and dune stabilization. Albatross use nohu (Tribulus cistoides) to reinforce their nest mounds against rain and wind and ‘Ua’u kani, or Wedge-tailed shearwater, (Puffinus pacificus) preferentially burrow under Kawelu (Eragrostis variabilis) because its dense root systems stabilize the sandy soil. Naupaka (Scaevola sericea) is the key dune stabilizer plant, protecting Green Island and its associated species from large storm events, tsunamis and potential sea rise from climate change. Invasive plants are a significant management concern because they displace native plant habitat and seabird nesting areas, entrap seabirds in dense vegetative mass, and outcompete native plants for natural resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
