This remote sensing project was completed as an assignment for my Master's program course, Environmental Data Science 220: Remote Sensing.


## Project Details

This project was created to provide an introduction to using satellite data from the USGS Landsat 8 Level 2, Collection 2, Tier 1 sourced from Google Earth Engine for analysis to identify soil composition.

Landsat 8 is a joint effort between USGS and NASA, with data collected from 2013-04-11 to the present. This particular dataset is the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance and land surface temperature from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensors.

This project used the Google Earth Engine API to download Landsat 8 data in order to explore potential habitat for an endangered plant species. By comparing NDVI and OIF bands, this study was able to determine possible regions of high gypsum concentration in the Guadalupe Mountains. All analysis was completed in Jupyter Lab using Python.

## Usage

**Identifying Gypsic Soils Using Landsat 8 Data**
Mapping habitat suitability for the identification and conservation of the Guadalupe Mountain necklacepod (*Sophora gypsophila*)

*Sophora gypsophila* is a G1 Critically Endangered shrub in the pea family endemic to a small area surrounding the Guadalupe mountains in Southeastern New Mexico and Western Texas. Part of what puts *S. gypsophila* at risk is the fact that it is a substrate obligate - in other words, it can only survive in a specific soil type. But this also gives us an advantage: it means that we can identify potentially suitable habitat simply by mapping the gypsic areas in the vicinity of existing populations of *S. gypsophila* and subsetting these areas by the plant's known elevation range. This can be done using Landsat bands 1, 5, and 7, taking advantage of the fact that gypsic soils are highly reflective in band 5 but particularly nonreflective in band 7.

### Real-color Landsat visualization

Potential suitable habitat for *Sophora gypsophila* is located in the Guadalupe Mountain range of southern New Mexico and western Texas. This region of interest was defined through research by Stafford et al. (2008). We set the parameters that will be needed for this analysis by creating a buffer with a 50km radius around the known species habitat area. The Landsat images that correspond with this region of interest were downloaded using the Google Earth Engine API.

### Analysis parameters
First, we use the difference between bands 6 and 7 divided by their sum (normalized ratio similar to NDVI calculation) to identify the normalized difference gypsum index for gypsic soils. The equation is Band 6 - Band 7)/(Band 6 + Band 7). We expect to produce a map that displays white for potential areas with high gypsic content.

## Results

We expected a map to display areas with high gypsic soils as white. There was a problem with the initial result as some areas area clearly identified as crop circles show up white in addition to soils with high gypsum content. This means that vegetation is also being detected by our normalized difference gypsum index band - not what we want. 

![Intermediate analysis](images/bw.png)

To fix this, we added another band, this time calculating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with the same math we used to calculate the normalized difference gypsum index, but using bands 4 (red) and 5 (near-infrared).

NDVI is a dimensionless index that captures the difference between visible and near-infrared reflectance used to estimate vegetation cover.

By mapping normalized difference gypsum index and NDVI together, we should be able to differentiate between soil and vegetation: this is because vegetation will appear in both bands (show in purple below), but gypsic soils will only appear in normalized difference gypsum index (shown in red below).

![Final analysis](images/result.png)
In summary, this project used the Google Earth Engine API to download Landsat 8 data in order to explore potential habitat for an endangered plant species. *Sophora gypsophila* is endangered, therefore data for  known locations is not available to the public. By comparing NDVI and normalized difference gypsum index bands, this study was able to determine possible regions of high gypsum concentration in the Guadalupe Mountains. These gypsic soil regions are potential suitable habitat to rare, endemic species such as *Sophora gypsophila*.

Gypsic soil areas were mapped using the difference ratio of Bands 6 and 7. After plotting the normalized difference gypsum index with the NDVI we can see areas that are presumed to be gypics soils standout much more compared to areas that are known to have vegetation.

## Future Research and Other Use Cases

This analysis use case allows biologist to prioritize areas of potential habitat suitability for survey for rare, threatened species such as S. gypsophila. Field surveys could be conducted to determine predictive accuracy via ground truthing. Another consideration to calculate more precise estimates for S. gypsophila habitat would be to overlay an elevation map and select for gypsic soil and elevation range. The known elevation range of S. gypsophila populations is between 1,000 and 5,000 feet above sea level. Combining both areas of high gypsic soil and elevation data would provide more precise suitabile habitat areas. An additional step in adapting Landsat data for conservation purposes would be comparing the identified potential Sophora habitat with land ownership maps in the region to target separate management solutions for public and private land.

General uses for this type of analysis is far reaching. Federal agencies or renewable energy developers could use this analysis to predict areas where rare or threatened plant species may be located but there is a lack of accurate population distribution documentation, areas coined as "botanical black holes". Identifying areas that may have high level of endemism may assist with environmental impact assessments or future graduate research sites. This analysis could also be used identifying locations for new agricultural areas or for potential renewable energy development suitablility. Similar case studies have successfully identified soils with high salts content.
