Holaniku is known as the Kure Atoll state wildlife sanctuary, and is located 1400 miles (2300 km) northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii at 28° 25’N latitude and 178° 20’ W longitude. The sanctuary is managed by the State of Hawaii Division of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) and is a part of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (PMNM) created in 2006. In 1978, Holaniku was included in the Hawaii State Seabird Sanctuary system.
